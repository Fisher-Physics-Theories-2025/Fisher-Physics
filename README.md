# Fisher Physics Hypotheses (2025)

This repository contains two original hypotheses proposed by **Clinton Fisher** in 2025, alongside timestamped attribution documents. The work explores foundational questions in theoretical physics, including quantum observation, time, gravity, and the emergent nature of reality.

## üìö Included Documents

### 1. **The Observer Threshold Hypothesis**
> A hypothesis exploring how observation, light, and gravity intersect to create the arrow of time and collapse quantum superposition.

### 2. **The Jellfold Hypothesis**
> A larger theoretical framework proposing that reality behaves like a folded fluidic continuum‚Äîpossibly connecting quantum entanglement, time suspension, and relativistic constraints into a unified spatial-energetic system.
