# 🧠 Fisher Physics Theories – Clinton Fisher (2025)

This repository contains the original cosmological hypotheses developed by Clinton Fisher in 2025. These works propose a new boundary-based framework for understanding time, space, entropy, and universal structure — challenging classical assumptions of infinity and reconciling relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmological expansion.

All hypotheses are timestamped, publicly archived, and accessible via DOI.

## 📚 Core Hypotheses

### 1. 🚨 The Light-Speed Boundary and Big Bang Hypothesis
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15709421](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15709421)
- **Summary:**  
  Proposes that the Big Bang marks a rupture from a realm of non-being at the speed of light. At \(v = c\), time, entropy, and existence cannot persist. This boundary marks both the origin of being and the outer limit of physics.

### 2. 🔁 The Light-Speed Cycle Hypothesis
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15713769](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15713769)
- **Summary:**  
  Suggests the universe is cyclic. As cosmic expansion accelerates toward \(v \to c\), existence dissolves — triggering a new Big Bang. This forms a repeating light-speed-driven cosmological cycle.

### 3. 🌌 The Finite Universe Boundary Hypothesis
- **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.15716010](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15716010)
- **Summary:**  
  Reframes the universe as finite, not infinite. At a relativistic boundary (\(v = c\)), mass, entropy, and time collapse to zero. This creates a measurable “dissolution shell” — the true limit of reality.

---

### 4. 🧩 The Observer Threshold Hypothesis
- **Summary:**  
  Describes observation as the convergence of light (timeless), gravity (curved time), and quantum measurement. Reality forms only when these align — defining collapse not as passive detection, but active creation.

---

### 5. 🪐 The Jellfold Hypothesis
- **Summary:**  
  Envisions the universe as a seamless, entangled field. Collapse events (e.g. mass, measurement) create localized folds — generating time, causality, and structure. The Jellfold contains all other hypotheses as subsystems.
