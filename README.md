# Fisher Physics Theories (2025)
**Clinton Fisher**  
A collection of original theoretical physics hypotheses proposing new foundations for time, spacetime, quantum collapse, and cosmogenesis.

## ðŸ”· 1. The Light-Speed Boundary Hypothesis (LSBH)
**SHA-256 Verified | Clinton Fisher, 2025**

This hypothesis reframes the speed of light as the **ontological boundary** between existence and nonexistence. At or beyond light speed, nothing exists â€” not even laws or logic. The **Big Bang** is reinterpreted as the **first boundary breach**, where something structured crossed from this timeless null into causal spacetime. It proposes that accelerating matter to this boundary may trigger new universe creation.

## ðŸ”· 2. The Observer Threshold Hypothesis
**SHA-256 Verified | Clinton Fisher, 2025**

This hypothesis proposes that time, causality, and classical reality emerge only when three things converge:
- Light (timeless in its own frame)
- Curved spacetime (gravity)
- Observation (measurement)

Observation is not passive; it is **generative**, acting as the **threshold event** where reality is constructed moment-by-moment.

## ðŸ”· 3. The Jellfold Hypothesis
**SHA-256 Verified | Clinton Fisher, 2025**

Reality is a seamless, fluid entangled manifold â€” like a quantum jelly. Observation, gravity, and collapse cause **deformations** in this substrate, creating spacetime ripples. The Jellfold model proposes that time and causality are not fundamental but emerge from **topological pressure points** in this field.

## ðŸ”— Interconnected Framework

These three hypotheses form a unified cosmological model:

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **LSBH** | The origin of spacetime from a boundary crossing (cosmogenesis) |
| **Jellfold** | The structure of spacetime as a seamless entangled fluid |
| **Observer Threshold** | The activation point of reality through measurement |

- Summary: Proposes the universe may cyclically dissolve into nonexistence at light speed, triggering repeated Big Bangs via boundary rupture.
